Infectious Diseases
===================

.. note::

Although Infectious Diseases are Legally not minimal data (therefore not collected after 10 years follow-up) and collected only under specific circumstances (e.g. required Hospitalization) in case of Simplified data collection, **when Infection/s is/are cause of death then the infection should be collected anyhow so to allow the death form to be linked to the specific infection/s.**
