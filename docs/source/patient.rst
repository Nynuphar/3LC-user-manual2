Patient
*******************

.. tip::
   When a patient is created, it cannot deleted by an LDM. Please open a ticket to the IT.

Registration
========================

The STCS started to keep a screening log of SOAS waitlisted patients in the STCS IT system. 
That means we only register the waitlist SOAS number of the transplant candidate together with the current consent status. 
This screening log registration does not involve collection of clinical data or research data.

The reason for this change is to improve the access to patients’ informed consent (IC) information and to better guide STCS procedures according to IC information (see section 3.2 of the study protocol). Please note that since cohort initiation, STCS patient enrolment only starts with transplantation.

The Ethics Committee has approved the registration of waitlisted (not yet transplanted) patients in the database. Registered information includes current consent status. No collection of clinical/research data is allowed before transplantation and proper enrollment in the Cohort only starts at the time of transplantation.

.. note::
   If the patient dies while on the waiting list, this information should not be entered in the system as it is a clinical data. The patient should 
   be left “open” in waiting list.




Administrative data
--------

.. note::
   The patient should be entered in the database within 7 days after transplantation (two working days). The minimal entry should containt: initials, date of birth and consent status with date.

How to enter initials into the New system:

.. note::
   
   One uppercase initial per name, with "-" as separator between First name initial/s and Last name initial/s e.g. Georgios Kyriakos Panayiotou -> 
   GK-P e.g. Rosa Dolores Alverío Marcano -> RD-AM Family names that include particles are treated as a further Family name. E.g.Charles De Gaulle - 
   > C-DG e.g. Miguel De Oliveira -> M-DO

Enrollment
=======================

Certain patients leave our requests to consent unanswered during the waitlist period. This means that when the patient is called for transplantation, there is neither consent nor refusal to STCS. In the vast majority (i.e. ~95%), patients subsequently consent once the transplantation has taken place. To preserve human resources and to avoid delays in data entry, the best solution for the STCS is to start collecting routine clinical data from the transplant centers (i.e. only existing non-genetic personal data from patient charts) shortly after transplantation with reference to the time point of transplantation, even if the consent has not yet been signed. 

.. note::
   It is important to note that neither samples are drawn nor psychosocial questionnaire (PSQ) data are collected as long a no consent is signed. 

The great majority of patients consent soon after transplantation and the mentioned routine clinical data are of great importance for the validity of the research. If the patient refuses to consent or the consent remains permanently absent after transplantation, no STCS data will be reused for research. Once the patient provides consent, all STCS procedures start.
The PSQ data collection schedule was simplified. Whereas previously PSQ was collected yearly, the schedule is now reduced as follows: at wait listing, 6 months, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and every 5 years thereafter

Consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation
--------------------------------------------------------------
In case of consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation, the Ethics Committee has approved the collection of full data from the time of transplantation. Therefore, all data can be collected. This includes patient history, Baseline data, transplantation data and any data in between transplantation and the time the consent gets signed. If the patient finally gives consent, all data collected will be kept and can be used for research. Samples and PSQ can be collected as soon as the consent is retrieved (see CASE n°1).
Reminder: As per email from Nadine Beerli sent out to LDM on March 7th, 2023, new PSQ schedule (Pre-Tx, 6 months post-Tx, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 years post-Tx and every 5 years thereafter) has been implemented as of April 1st, 2023.

If no consent is retrieved after transplantation, data collected will be kept in the system but will not be used for research. No samples or PSQ will be collected (see CASE n°2).
