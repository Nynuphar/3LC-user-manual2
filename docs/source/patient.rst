Patient
*******************

.. tip::
   When a patient is created, it cannot deleted by an LDM. Please open a ticket to the IT.

Registration (SOAS Listing)
========================

The Ethics Committee has approved the registration of waitlisted (not yet transplanted) patients in the database. Registered information includes current consent status. No collection of clinical/research data is allowed before transplantation and proper enrollment in the Cohort only starts at the time of transplantation.

.. tip::
   1. Register patient in STCS when you send Patient information to patient
   2. Add SOAS number and Organ
   3. Register consent as “Absent (awaiting)” with date when ICF sent out
   4. When you get consent form back then update consent with date
   5. Enroll patient only once transplanted (add transplantation and donor etc)


.. note::
   If the patient dies while on the waiting list, this information should not be entered in the system as it is a clinical data. The patient should 
   be left “open” in waiting list.



Administrative data

Collected data, direct link to ecodebook collection: https://codebook.stcs.ch/codebook/collections/0x219233/release/0xaaeaf

.. note::
   The patient should be entered in the database within 7 days after transplantation (two working days). 

How to enter initials into the New system:

.. note::
   
   One uppercase initial per name, with "-" as separator between First name initial/s and Last name initial/s e.g. Georgios Kyriakos Panayiotou -> 
   GK-P e.g. Rosa Dolores Alverío Marcano -> RD-AM Family names that include particles are treated as a further Family name. E.g.Charles De Gaulle - 
   > C-DG e.g. Miguel De Oliveira -> M-DO

Enrollment
=======================

The transplantation is the event that triggers the patient enrolment.
