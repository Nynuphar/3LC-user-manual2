Registration
========================

The STCS started to keep a screening log of SOAS waitlisted patients in the STCS IT system. 
That means we only register the waitlist SOAS number of the transplant candidate together with the current consent status. 
This screening log registration does not involve collection of clinical data or research data. 
The reason for this change is to improve the access to patients’ informed consent (IC) information and to better guide STCS procedures according to IC information (see section 3.2 of the study protocol). Please note that since cohort initiation, STCS patient enrolment only starts with transplantation.


Initials
--------

How to enter initials into the New system:

.. note::
   
   One uppercase initial per name, with "-" as separator between First name initial/s and Last name initial/s e.g. Georgios Kyriakos Panayiotou -> 
   GK-P e.g. Rosa Dolores Alverío Marcano -> RD-AM Family names that include particles are treated as a further Family name. E.g.Charles De Gaulle - 
   > C-DG e.g. Miguel De Oliveira -> M-DO

Enrollment
=======================

Certain patients leave our requests to consent unanswered during the waitlist period. This means that when the patient is called for transplantation, there is neither consent nor refusal to STCS. In the vast majority (i.e. ~95%), patients subsequently consent once the transplantation has taken place. To preserve human resources and to avoid delays in data entry, the best solution for the STCS is to start collecting routine clinical data from the transplant centers (i.e. only existing non-genetic personal data from patient charts) shortly after transplantation with reference to the time point of transplantation, even if the consent has not yet been signed. 

.. note::
   It is important to note that neither samples are drawn nor psychosocial questionnaire (PSQ) data are collected as long a no consent is signed. 

The great majority of patients consent soon after transplantation and the mentioned routine clinical data are of great importance for the validity of the research. If the patient refuses to consent or the consent remains permanently absent after transplantation, no STCS data will be reused for research. Once the patient provides consent, all STCS procedures start.
The PSQ data collection schedule was simplified. Whereas previously PSQ was collected yearly, the schedule is now reduced as follows: at wait listing, 6 months, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and every 5 years thereafter
