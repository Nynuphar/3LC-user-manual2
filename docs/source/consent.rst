Consent
########

.. note::
   The LDM has to make sure that each newly listed patient is appropriately informed about the goals of the STCS and that each listed patient in Switzerland will receive an invitation letter to join the STCS, an informed 
   consent form, and the pre-transplant PSQ. The LTC has to inform the LDM within 7 days if a new patient is added to the transplant waiting list.

Definitions and types of consents
******************************************

- **Present**: We have a signed Informal Consent (IC) from the patient.
- **Absent (awaiting)**: We do not have an IC. This often occurs, when the Patient did not return the signed IC before TX and it was not possible to get the consent before opening the new case. It may also occur, if a patient is listed as ‘super urgent’ and/or was unable to sign the IC due to medical reasons. In this instance, the IC must be clarified as soon as possible!
- **Absent (documented refusal)**: The patient refused to participate to the STCS in an oral or written form, even following a personal discussion with one of our staff.
- **Absent (other)**: This means, we could not clarify the participation of this patient in the STCS and the patient is still alive. Select specific option, e.g. "Reminder process closed", "Language/Communication barrier".
- **Absent (death)**: the patient died while consent was "Absent (awaiting)*.
- **Withdrawal**: At the point we enter the patient as ‘new patient’ in the database, we have an IC from the patient. At a later point, this patient informs us that he no longer wishes to participate in the STCS. We now change the consent status from ‘Present’ to ‘Withdrawal’. From this point on, only minimal data is collected from this patient.
- **Absent (ReCap)**: This is only relevant for patients who have been transplanted between 01. january 2008 and 30. April 2008. The data of these patient is entered as ‘minimal dataset’. As date of IC 01.01.2008 was entered.

Consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Certain patients leave the requests to consent unanswered during the waitlist period. This means that when the patient is called for transplantation, there is neither consent nor refusal to STCS. In the vast majority (i.e. ~95%), patients subsequently consent once the transplantation has taken place. To preserve human resources and to avoid delays in data entry, the best solution for the STCS is to start collecting routine clinical data from the transplant centers (i.e. only existing non-genetic personal data from patient charts) shortly after transplantation with reference to the time point of transplantation, even if the consent has not yet been signed. 

.. note::
   It is important to note that **neither samples are drawn nor psychosocial questionnaire (PSQ) data are collected as long a no consent is signed**. 

The great majority of patients consent soon after transplantation and the mentioned routine clinical data are of great importance for the validity of the research. If the patient refuses to consent or the consent remains permanently absent after transplantation, no STCS data will be reused for research. Once the patient provides consent, all STCS procedures start.
The PSQ data collection schedule was simplified. Whereas previously PSQ was collected yearly, the schedule is now reduced as follows: at wait listing, 6 months, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and every 5 years thereafter

In other words: 
In case of consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation, the Ethics Committee has approved the collection of full data from the time of transplantation. Therefore, all data can be collected. This includes patient history, Baseline data, transplantation data and any data in between transplantation and the time the consent gets signed. If the patient finally gives consent, all data collected will be kept and can be used for research. Samples and PSQ can be collected as soon as the consent is retrieved (see CASE n°1).

If no consent is retrieved after transplantation, data collected will be kept in the system but will not be used for research. No samples or PSQ will be collected (see CASE n°2).

Attempts to obtain an Informed Consent
--------------------------------------
.. note::
   Before Transplantation: Three attempts before transplantation (Attempts can be in writing or oral and must be documented in the IT system), if still unkown then one attempt to obtain written consent up to 6-months, if 
   still unknown and for specific cases, one attempt between 6-months follow-up and 1-year follow-up.

Important Notes and Tips
------------------------

.. note::
   No need to re-consent in case of re-tpx, unless the patient never gave an answer, neither yes nor no. Consent does NOT depend on the organ. 
   Consent is for STCS and STCS involves all organ TX.

.. note::
   Oral refusal is enough, document it please in the STCS system.

.. note::
   Consent withdrawal, please use the form with written confirmation (although legally not required).
