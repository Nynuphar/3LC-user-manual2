Consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation
--------------------------------------------------------------

Certain patients leave the requests to consent unanswered during the waitlist period. This means that when the patient is called for transplantation, there is neither consent nor refusal to STCS. In the vast majority (i.e. ~95%), patients subsequently consent once the transplantation has taken place. To preserve human resources and to avoid delays in data entry, the best solution for the STCS is to start collecting routine clinical data from the transplant centers (i.e. only existing non-genetic personal data from patient charts) shortly after transplantation with reference to the time point of transplantation, even if the consent has not yet been signed. 

.. note::
   It is important to note that neither samples are drawn nor psychosocial questionnaire (PSQ) data are collected as long a no consent is signed. 

The great majority of patients consent soon after transplantation and the mentioned routine clinical data are of great importance for the validity of the research. If the patient refuses to consent or the consent remains permanently absent after transplantation, no STCS data will be reused for research. Once the patient provides consent, all STCS procedures start.
The PSQ data collection schedule was simplified. Whereas previously PSQ was collected yearly, the schedule is now reduced as follows: at wait listing, 6 months, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and every 5 years thereafter

In other words: 
In case of consent “Absent (awaiting)” at the time of transplantation, the Ethics Committee has approved the collection of full data from the time of transplantation. Therefore, all data can be collected. This includes patient history, Baseline data, transplantation data and any data in between transplantation and the time the consent gets signed. If the patient finally gives consent, all data collected will be kept and can be used for research. Samples and PSQ can be collected as soon as the consent is retrieved (see CASE n°1).

If no consent is retrieved after transplantation, data collected will be kept in the system but will not be used for research. No samples or PSQ will be collected (see CASE n°2).

Important Notes and Tips
------------------------

.. note::
   No need to re-consent in case of re-tpx, unless the patient never gave an answer, neither yes nor no. Consent does NOT depend on the organ. 
   Consent is for STCS and STCS involves all organ TX.

.. note::
   Oral refusal is enough, document it please in the STCS system.

.. note::
   Consent withdrawal, please use the form with written confirmation (although legally not required).
