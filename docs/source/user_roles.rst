User roles
===========

The project has the following user roles:

* _Ldm user_ (local study nurse user). The main user of the STCS system. Is employee of a given local TX center (BE, CHUV, HUG, SG, USB, USZ). The ldm user has edit rights for all patients of the TX center and of all patients that are shared with his/her center (see below).

* _Local investigator_. Sees all patients of the center and all shared patients. Sees audit trial of all changes. Read-only access.

* _HLA_Lab_: Can use the Sample Manager App to modify data associated to samples retrieval of his/her own center (and those from shared patients).

* _Global_Viewer_:

Access: _Local_: Access to patient (data) of a given TX center and all patients that are shared with that center. Note: local users have access to all donors. Each ldm user irrespective of the center has the right to access, add and modify data of the donor. 
_Global_: sees all patients.

User rights: Usually, the access is on the entire patient. In the future, restricted access to certain specific forms of a patient may be needed for external users. Rights: Read and edit data, verify and confirm new users (DC superuser)

User authentication: Users can apply for accounts through their email. Account activation through DC superuser; automatic notification to user when account is activated.
