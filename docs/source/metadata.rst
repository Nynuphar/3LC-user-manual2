We are for example looking for the metadata collected for Kidney, so we can search (CTRL + F) for the word "Kidney". Now the kidney-specific collections (forms or containers) are highlighted. We click on "KidneyBiopsyAndRejection" cause we are interested in exploring the variables collected in this container, therefore we click on the indicated number of variables.

The list of variables appears and we can explor the entire list by scrolling down.

For example we are interested in seeying which values are collected for Kidney rejection, therefore we click on the variable Label.
